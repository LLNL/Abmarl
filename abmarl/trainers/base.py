        Generate an episode of data.

        The fundamental data object is a SAR, a (state, action, reward) tuple.
        We restart the sim, generating initial observations (states) for agents
        reporting from the sim. Then we use the compute_action function to generate
        actions for agents who report an observation. Those actions are given to the sim,
        which steps forward and generates rewards and new observations for reporting
        agents. This loop continues until the simulation is done or we hit the
        horizon.

        Args:
            horizon: The maximum number of steps per epsidoe. The episode may
                finish early, but it will not progress further than this number
                of steps.
            render: Renders the simulation. This should be False when training,
                and can be True when debugging or evaluating in post-processing.

        Returns:
            Four dictionaries, one for observations, another for actions,
                another for rewards, and another for dones. This makes the SAR sequence
                and provides additional information on the done condition since some
                algorithms need this. The data is organized by agent_id, so you would call
                {observations, actions, rewards}[agent_id][i]
                in order to extract the ith SAR for an agent.

                each agent.
