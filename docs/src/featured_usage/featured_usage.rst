   <h2> JCATS Interface </h2>

In this experiment, we study how collaborative and competitive behaviors emerge
among agents in a partially observable stochastic game. In our simulation, each
agent occupies a square and can move around the map. Each agent can "attack"
agents that are on a different "team"; the attacked agent loses its life and
is removed from the simulation. Each agent can observe the state of the map in
a region surrounding its location. It can see other agents and what team they're
on as well as the edges of the map. The diagram below visuially depicts the agents'....
