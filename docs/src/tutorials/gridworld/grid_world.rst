GridWorld
=========

The GridWorld Simulation Framework is composed of feature components that fit together
to allow users to create a variety of simulations using the same pieces and to easily
design their own features. We provide tutorials demonstrating the special features
of this framework. First, we create a multi-team battle simulation
using built-in features components. We then show how the exact same components can be
reconfigured to create a maze-navigation simulation. Finally, we show how easy
it is to add custom features as components and plug them into the simulation framework.
