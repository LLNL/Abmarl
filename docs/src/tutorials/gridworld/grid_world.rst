GridWorld
=========

GridWorld Simulation Framework is composed of feature modules that fit together
to allow users to create a variety of simulations using the same pieces and to easily
design their own features. We provide tutorials highlighting the special features
of GridWorld Simulation Framework. First, we create a multi-team battle simulation
using built-in features modules. We then show how the exact same modules can be
reconfigured to create a maze-navigation simulation. Finally, we show how easy
it is to add custom features as modules and plug them into the simulation framework.
