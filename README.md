# Admiral

Admiral is a package for developing Agent-Based Simulations and training them with
MultiAgent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We provide an intuitive command line
interface for engaging with the full workflow of MARL experimentation: training,
visualizing, and analyzing agent behavior. We define an Agent-Based
Simulation Interface and Simulation Manager, which control which agents interact
with the simulation at each step. We support integration with popular reinforcement
learning simulation interfaces, including gym.Env and MultiAgentEnv.

Admiral leverages RLlibâ€™s framework for reinforcement learning and extends it to
more easily support custom simulations, algorithms, and policies. We enable researchers to rapidly
prototype MARL experiments and simulation design and lower the barrier for pre-existing
projects to prototype RL as a potential solution.
