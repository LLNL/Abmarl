-----------------
Admiral was funded as an ISCP project through Computing's Idea Day call. What you
see here is a minimal viable product (MVP), with enhancements planned in future
ISCP projects. However, this project is meant to be primarily *community driven*.
If you use Admiral in your workflow, please consider contributing any features
you think would be useful to the greater RL community. In addition, please contact
me or fill out a "new issue" if you encounter any bugs or want features to be
implemented.
